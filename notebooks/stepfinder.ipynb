       "0) Find the optimum `filter_time`, by repeating work-steps 1) - 3) with\n",
       "different filter_times and analyse the results.\n",
       "\n",
       "1) Filter the data with the forward-backward non-linear filter proposed by\n",
       "Chung & Kennedy (1991, J. Neuroscience) [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "2) After that it searches for steps by comparing the difference of the\n",

       "expected_min_step_size (-> threshold y_c) and the expected_min_dwell_t\n",
       "(-> min_step_spacing, E in paper) decide wether there is a step or not. See\n",
       "Smith (1998, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B) [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "3) In the last step, steps are being deleted when they are smaller than a\n",
       "minimum allowed step size (see parameter `step_size_threshold` and function\n",
       "`get_min_step_sizes()`). This is important, because statistical\n",
       "fluctuations can locally look like large steps, even if the plateau behind\n",
       "such a step is about the same height as the plateau before.\n",

       "Besides these main working steps, information about dwell time and step\n",
