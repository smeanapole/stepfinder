       "0) Find the optimum `filter_time`, by repeating work-steps 1) - 3) with\n",
       "different filter_times and analyse the results.\n",

       "1) Filter the data with the forward-backward non-linear filter proposed by\n",

       "\n",
       "2) After that it searches for steps by comparing the difference of the\n",

       "expected_min_step_size (-> threshold y_c) and the expected_min_dwell_t\n",
       "(-> min_step_spacing, E in paper) decide wether there is a step or not. See\n",
       "Smith (1998, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B) [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "3) In the last step, steps are being deleted when they are smaller than a\n",
       "minimum allowed step size (see parameter `step_size_threshold` and function\n",
       "`get_min_step_sizes()`). This is important, because statistical\n",
       "fluctuations can locally look like large steps, even if the plateau behind\n",
       "such a step is about the same height as the plateau before.\n",

       "Besides these main working steps, information about dwell time and step\n",

       "\n",
       "Application:\n",
       "============\n",
       "See [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "Remarks:\n",
       "========\n",
       "Regarding the parameters `filter_tmin_t`, `filter_tmax_t` and\n",
       "`filter_time`:\n",
       "High values smoothen the noise, but probably also diminish the signal. Low\n",
       "values leave the signals intact, but probably do not sufficiently reduce\n",
       "the noise. Medium values smoothen the noise and leave the signals intact\n",
       "and thereby increase the SNR of the data.\n",
       "\n",
       "From [1]:\n",
       "\"The number of predictors [here only 1 forward and 1 backward] and their\n",
       "lengths can be varied. Three short pairs of the predictors used to extract\n",
       "exponentially decaying signals imbedded in the noise [...] preserved the\n",
       "original features of the signal, but the background noise was not\n",
       "effectively suppressed [...]. As the predictors of longer lengths were\n",
       "added [...], a further reduction in the noise was achieved at the expense\n",
       "of distorting the original signal. Although there are a large number of\n",
       "possible predictor combinations that can be used for processing a segment\n",
       "of data, the choice of the bank of predictors in practice is\n",
       "straightforward. Various choices of lengths of predictors should be based\n",
       "on the expected durations of signal features. If, for example, we\n",
